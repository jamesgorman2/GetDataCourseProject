# Code Book - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The data in [`uci_har_means_long.txt`](https://github.com/jamesgorman2/GetDataCourseProject/blob/master/uci_har_means_long.txt)
is derived from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
(HAR).[[1]](#ref1) It was downloaded from [the mirror](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
provided by [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-009/), and is used by default in
[`run_analysis.R`](https://github.com/jamesgorman2/GetDataCourseProject/blob/master/run_analysis.R).

The analysis in [`uci_har_means_long.txt`](https://github.com/jamesgorman2/GetDataCourseProject/blob/master/uci_har_means_long.txt)
is designed to fulfil the requirements of the
[Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-009/human_grading/view/courses/972587/assessments/3)
and provides no real analytic insight.
The original data is taken from 30 volunteer performing 6 activites, being measured using the accelerometer and gyroscope of a
Samsung Galaxy S II mounted at the waist. For a description of the original data, see `README.txt` in the original data.
